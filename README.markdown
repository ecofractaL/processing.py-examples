## What is processing.py ##

processing.py is a port of [processing](http://processing.org) to python based on jython and hence should be compatible with vanilla processing libraries. The [tools folder] (https://github.com/monkstone/processing.py-examples/tree/master/tools) contains some useful [tools](https://github.com/monkstone/processing.py-examples/downloads) for processing.py _for using jEdit as an ide, and/or extracting 64bit binaries_. Until processing.py gets its own mode in the regular processing ide, even non linux users might find my jEdit tools be handy.  The examples demonstrate the terse syntax of python (_cf java and even regular processing in some instances_).

## Alternatives ##

[pyprocessing](http://code.google.com/p/pyprocessing/) is a pure python based implementation of processing, based on the [pyglet](http://www.pyglet.org/) games engine. I find [Eric5](http://eric-ide.python-projects.org/eric-download.html) to be an excellent ide for pyprocessing.
